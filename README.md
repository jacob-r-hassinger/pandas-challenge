Two Notable Trends

1) Schools within highest spending per student group ($645 - 675 budget per student) surprisingly had the lowest Overall Passing Rate (Overall Passing %). 
	The two lowest groups of spending per student had the higher Passing Rates.
	This seems to suggest that budget per student is not indicative of Passing Rate.

2) Schools within the largest size grouping (2000 - 5000 students) had the lowest Overall Passing Rate on average (Overall Passing %).
	The two smaller groups (<1000, and 1000 - 2000 students) had significantly higher Overall Passing Rates.

Considerations for further analysis:
	It would be important to consider the ranges of the size groupings to gain further insight into the Overall Passing Rates of large schools.
		The largest grouping (2000 - 5000 students) had a much wider range than the other two groups, which may impact the reliability of the results.
		Evaluating size based on equal ranges may impact results.
	
	Districts had lower scores in all categories than Charter schools: average scores, overall passing rates, and individual score passing rates.
		Further insights could be found by comparing the impacts of other variables (size, budget) in addition to School Type.
